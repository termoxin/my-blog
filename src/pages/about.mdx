# Hello 👋

I’m Rostyslav Futornyi or to be more concise — **Ros**

I’m a Software Engineer who currently building UI interfaces for an international money transfer company with over 10 million users.

I’m the author of [Termo English](https:/t.me/termo_english) project the helps people all over the world to learn English using interactive posts and short movie clips. Also, I am currently building web platform for [Termo English](https://github.com/termoxin/thermo-english) **that's gonna change the way how people learn English online** 🚀

Generally, I’m into creating things that help to mitigate people’s suffering and make them happier, their lives better and opportunities wider.

I have a Telegram [blog](https://t.me/rostislav_codes) as well. Mostly, I'm posting some thoughts, random stuff that come to my mind.

## What is this blog about?

I started [futornyi.com](futornyi.com) as a place to keep my journey documented. It is also a good place to show the progress that I'm doing in my projects and the things I'm working on.

Having a personal blog is a good opportunity to meet new people that have the same passion that I have and create something **big** together. Yeah, I'm talking about you. Yeah, I sad — "You"

Feel free to [contact](https://t.me/termoxin) me 📞

You can always take a look at what decision I've made, what results I've got and apply them to your own life 💡

Welcome!

**Be yourself wonderful self and follow your ❤️**
