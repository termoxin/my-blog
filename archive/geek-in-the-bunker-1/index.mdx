## War Is Shit

## It's a hard time, but we should survive

Yeah, it's gonna be hard times for everyone in the world because of Putin's aggression.
We should survive to make the world the best place to live for our children. The only way to pull it off is to gather together and <s><b>make peace consensus between both sides</b></s> kill the aggressor, throw it apart.

## How's it going, man?

I'm good, thank you👍

I'm based outside the city of Odessa. I was supposed to be in Poland right now, but war ruined my plans and my lovely girlfriend and I are not going anywhere.
I'm not discouraged. I embraced the current situation and I'm happy about everything. I have a dream job, I have a dream girlfriend, my life is a dream.

If you haven't read about me here it is [About me page](/about). I'm too lazy 🦥 to text it down here, so please read it [About me page](/about).

## What are these war chronicles about?

Simply, I'm gonna tell you about everything I can. How I'm surviving during the war.
What I'm doing in the bunker, and even how it feels to have sex at the moment when you see a nuclear bomb is falling into your city.

I'm joking 🤡 I'm sure it's not gonna happen soon. Figure it out for yourself 😏

## How's it going in the programming world in war realities?

I haven't noticed anything since the war started. IT sector is growing up and it's not gonna slow down <s><b>never</b></s> anytime soon.
I feel confident since I'm working on a blockchain project. It's stable, it's interesting and it makes me happy.

## Helping car owners to earn more money

I'm on the way to creating an IT product to help car owners to earn more money by renting out their cars. More you'll see in this blog soon. Most likely, it's gonna be for the Western side of the world, since the Ukraine car market is wobbly for now.

## Don't lecture me

Period. You know, my thoughts can be uncoherent, but I give a 💩 about it until it doesn't make me any worse
