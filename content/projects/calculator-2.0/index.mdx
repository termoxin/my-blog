# E-Bike Range Calculator 2.0 - Physics-Based Precision 🚴‍♀️🔋⚡

**Stop Guessing Your E-Bike Range. Know It. Exactly.**

[E-Bike Range Calculator 2.0](https://ebike.futornyi.com) is a complete rebrand and evolution of my e-bike range calculator, built from the ground up with real physics, not hopeful guesses. Trusted by **3,000+ riders** in **30+ countries** to predict range with **±2–5% accuracy** using real wind, elevation, drag, and battery physics. Validated on **1,000+ real rides**.

## The Problem: Range Anxiety Destroys Great Rides

Every year, thousands of riders get stranded or miss amazing routes because they trusted simple "km per Wh" guesses that ignored wind, elevation, and real physics. I experienced this firsthand—getting stranded twice on mountain passes, pushing a dead 28kg bike uphill, miles from the nearest outlet. Every calculator said I'd make it. None accounted for the headwind, the 12% grade, or my loaded panniers.

So I built the tool I desperately needed—one that uses real physics, not hopeful guesses.

## What Makes Calculator 2.0 Different

### Physics-Based Precision, Not Simple Formulas

While other calculators use shortcuts that guarantee inaccuracy (±15–40% error rate), Calculator 2.0 models real physics:

#### **Real Motor Efficiency Curves**
- Motor efficiency varies from 60% to 85% depending on speed and load
- Other calculators use average values; we model the full efficiency curve
- Real-world power draw calculated at every speed & torque level

#### **Wind Speed & Direction Modeling**
- A 20 km/h headwind can reduce range by 20–30%
- Most calculators don't even ask about wind
- We calculate aerodynamic resistance for every 100m segment with precise wind vectors

#### **Aerodynamic Drag Calculation**
- Models CdA (coefficient of drag × frontal area)
- Accounts for rider position (aero vs upright)
- Factors in cargo, trailers, and luggage

#### **Segment-by-Segment Physics**
- Gravitational forces calculated per 100m segment
- Recuperation on descents factored in
- Slope angles and elevation gain modeled precisely
- Not just total elevation—every climb matters

#### **Real Battery Discharge Modeling**
- Uses actual battery discharge curves
- Accounts for pedaling power (motor assistance drops when you pedal hard)
- Models recuperation and energy recovery

### Validated Accuracy

- **±2–5% accuracy** validated on 1,000+ real rides
- Trusted by riders in 30+ countries
- Real testimonials from touring cyclists, commuters, and mountain bikers

## Key Features

2. **We Run Real Physics** - Thousands of calculations per 100m segment: wind vectors, aerodynamic drag, gravitational forces, motor efficiency curves.

3. **Know Your Real Range** - Precise range predictions, detailed energy breakdown, charging stop recommendations—delivered in seconds.

### Interactive Demo

Try the live demo route to see how wind, elevation, and drag affect your range in real-time. Watch as each variable impacts battery consumption with precise physics modeling.

## Why Other Calculators Fail

### They Use Fixed Wh/km Consumption
Assuming 15 Wh/km works on flat ground at 20 km/h. But on a 10% climb at 15 km/h with a headwind? You'll use 40+ Wh/km. They can't model this.

### They Ignore Wind & Drag Entirely
A 20 km/h headwind can reduce range by 20–30%. Most calculators don't even ask about wind. We calculate aerodynamic resistance for every segment.

### No Real Motor Efficiency Curves
Motor efficiency varies from 60% to 85% depending on speed and load. They use average values. We model the full curve.

### They Skip Recuperation & Pedaling Power
On descents, you can recover energy. When you pedal hard, motor assistance drops. We factor both in.
