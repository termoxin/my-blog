Hi, üëã Nice to meet you again! I hope you had a great week

## Intro

To be honest, this was a tough week. Mostly, it was tough emotionally, a lot of struggle to went through. I think the biggest difficulty was because everything was gathered together and I should've fought against it, but I won with wounds.

This blog is not only about successes, achievements, but is for failures as well. You cannot succeed without failures.

Anyway because of that I didn't stop moving forward, 'cause I have a goal to create the best online English learning platform that's supposed to change the lives of a lot of people for to better.

Let get started without further ado...

## Difficulties

Obviously, the biggest difficulty was to organize time properly. I haven't done this from the beginning, so this is my bad. When your time isn't organized properly and you have a lot of things to do throughout the day ‚Äî procrastination comes to its place. It feels like you have a lot of things, but you cannot start anything because of you a lot of them. This is hard to overcome and start to do something. Sometimes, it happens, sometimes, it is not. It is like you pour your energy from an empty glass to another empty glass.

Fortunately, it's happened not the first time in my life, so I know the solution to the problem

## Solution

1. Getting up early 5:00 AM is the best time when I'm fuc\*ing productive
2. Have a calendar where every single hour in my life is planned
3. Rest as much as I can
4. Only think about, work on one thing at a time. Be in the present

I think the only vital problem is that I almost don't rest. Sometimes, it seems like I'm punishing myself for resting inside of my mind

## Gaming

A few weeks ago I started playing video games for 2-4 hours per week after 3 years break. It helps a little bit, but I'm looking for other ways to rest mentally

Mostly, I'm playing Horizon Zero Dawn. It has great graphics and a fascinating plot. From time to time, I'm playing GTA 5 and Far Cry 3 as well. These are definitely amazing games

## New book

I bought Yegor's Bugayenko book **"256 Bloghacks"**. I think it'll help me to create better quality content for you guys and make myself a better storyteller and writer

## Achievements

I managed to create the layout for the posts page and make some refinements for auth page. The current design is quite a row one, but I wanna present my work to you and I'll always be happy for feedback üòâ
