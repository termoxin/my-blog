## Intro

Hi! I hope you're doind well and living a great life üåû

The most of the developers review code. It's an axiom. Isn't it? I hope you're doing that at least for your code, but when it comes to review somebody code things are getting more complicated since we interact with the same human beings as we are and all of them have feelings, their own temper and personality. Of course, I expect you're not a reptiloid or alien, but I think it doesn't matter, because they review each other's code as well

And usually the most difficult thing is not to offend anybody and express your intentions in the best way. This is what I called it "moral side of code reviews" which goes along with "technical side of code reviews"

I want to warn you that's my opinion can be different from yours, so take it easy, analyze my thoughts because who knows maybe I'm a villain who wants to make you believe me and robs you

If you want to express your dissatisfaction, you can always let your comments in the section below üîΩ

## Don't criticize people, criticize their code

People tend to take everything personally. So, don't offend them, offend their code and don't point at them with your finger. If you see that you're not into something person created in their code don't say like "I think you've done in a bad way, so make it in this way". The sentence violates two "rules". "Don't criticize people, criticize their code" and "Don't order what to do, argue". To be honest, these "rules" are applicable not only for software engineering, but for usuall life as well, just replace words by your life domain and you're going to have the sets of actions

## Don't thrive vengeance

You probably had the situation where somebody reviewed your code harshly, they left a lot of comments, other nitty-gritty
things. Subconsciouslly, you probably do feel like thriving vengeance especially when you review their code the next time, you try to touch their feelings, emotions which **HORRIBLE** thing. Emotionally strong people are gonna ignore it or leave the place. I would recommend to do the same if somebody who reviews your code thrives vengeance. None of this is going to work in the long-run

In case you're thriving for vengeance it'd be better off to try to improve your code and code reviews by using their comments. The vengenace is the weekness the same as to be jelious. If you're doing that, **STOP** doing that. It'll make your life way more pleasurable

## Review meticulously

We're human beings (again, if you are not a reptiloid), and everybody can be wrong or miss something because of tiredness, feeling bad, breakup, whatever (in these situations it's better to take some rest), or because person focused on something else. So, please take a look at thing closer, try to see them in a little side. The person who wrote the code is gonna appeciate it a lot. You take a look at the things that you usually don't review. Meticulousleness can improve code quality drastically, therefore maintainability. Everybody will benefit from this

## Don't order what to do, argue

Don't say "Do this because I think it's better than you wrote it". These words are coming from toxic person, that nobody wants to deal with. Don't you want to be this kind of person?. Instead say something like this "Please, do this because I think my solution is better then this solution, since it has better performance and reability". Don't orget what to do, argue, give your arguments

## Be specific in your intentions and ideas

Being specific is something incrediably importants for code reviews. It can save your a lot of time

## Have a convention about when code can be reviewed

To avoid a misunderstanding it's better to have a convetion about when code can be reviewed. So instance, you can use labels in your ui of your code hosting (labels, or draft pull request functionality). Since your teammates need to know when code can be reviewed to don't encounter with the situation when you're still working on something and they are reviewing it from inside in and inside out

## Review code in auspicious for you time

Don't review code when you're super tired or when you just want to do something else other than reviewing somebody's code. I think the best time to review code is the time when you actually want it to review

## Keep trying

The road is made by walking; Walking makes the road".

## Brake huge pull request in small ones. People will appreciate it

For instance, you're working with frontend and you have a task to create a FAQ component. Create a representational side of the component first, create pull request, code a business part, create a pull request. If you have something infrastructure related (e.g. Terraform), create a terraform configuration file and create a pull request. In the end we have 3 completely different pull requests, which are easy to review (maybe not easier, but less painfully).
