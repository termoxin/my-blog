## Intro

Hi! I hope you're doind well and living a great life 🌞

The most of the developers review code. It's an axiom. Isn't it? I hope you're doing that at least for your code, but when it comes to review somebody code things are getting more complicated since we interact with the same human beings as we are and all of them have feelings, their own temper and personality. Of course, I expect you're not a reptiloid or alien, but I think it doesn't matter, because they review each other's code as well

And usually the most difficult things are not to offend anybody and express your intentions in the best polite way. This is what I called "moral side of code reviews" which goes along with "technical side of code reviews"

I want to warn you that's my opinion can be different from yours, so take it easy, analyze my thoughts because who knows maybe I'm a villain who wants to make you believe me and rob your house🧑‍🌾

If you want to express your dissatisfaction, give me some feedback, you can always left your comments in the section below 🔽

## Don't criticize people, criticize their code

People tend to take everything personally. So, don't offend them, offend their code and don't point at them with your finger. If you see that you're not into something that person created in their code don't say like "I think you've done in a bad way, so make it in this way". This sentence violates two "rules". "**Don't criticize people, criticize their code**" and "**Don't order what to do, argue**". To be honest, these "rules" are applicable not only for software engineering, but for usual life as well, just replace words by your life domain and you're going to have the sets of actions

## Don't thrive vengeance

You probably had the situation when somebody reviewed your code harshly, they left a lot of comments, other nitty-gritty
things. Subconsciouslly, you probably do feel like thriving vengeance especially when you review their code the next time, you want to touch their feelings, emotions which **INSANE** thing. Emotionally strong people are gonna ignore it or leave the place. I would recommend to do the same if somebody who reviews your code thrives vengeance. None of this is going to work in the long-run

In case you're thriving for vengeance it'd be better off to try to improve your code and code reviews by using their comments. The vengeance is the weekness the same as to be jelious. If you're doing that, **STOP** doing that. It'll make your life way more pleasurable

## Review meticulously

We're human beings (again, if you are not a reptiloid), and everybody can be wrong or miss something because of tiredness, feeling bad, breakup, whatever (in these situations it's better to take some rest), or because person focused on something else. So, please take a look at things closer, try to see them in a little bit different side. The person who wrote the code is gonna appeciate it a lot. You can start to look at every character, line. It'll give better understanding of the code you try to understand. Meticulousleness can improve code quality drastically, therefore maintainability. Everybody will benefit from this

## Don't order what to do, argue

Don't say "Do this because I think it's better than what you wrote". These words are coming from toxic person, that nobody wants to deal with. Don't you want to be this kind of person? Instead say something like this "Please, do this because I think my solution is better then the one you proposed, since it has better performance and readability". Don't order what to do, argue, give your arguments

## Be specific in your intentions and ideas

Being specific is something incredibly important for code reviews. Please be specific if you want your teammate to change an type interface — text which specific interface you want one to change. It can save a lot of your time and the time of the people you're engaging with

## Have a convention about when code can be reviewed

To avoid a misunderstanding it's better to have a indenture about when code can be reviewed. For instance, you can leverage features in UI of your code hosting (labels, or draft pull requests functionality). Since your teammates need to know when code can be reviewed to don't encounter with the situation when you're still working on something and they are reviewing it from inside in and inside out. You know the drill

## Review code in auspicious for you time

Don't review code when you're super tired or when you just want to do something else other than reviewing somebody's code. I think the best time to review code is the time when you actually want it to review. Don't confuse that procrastination and lazyness, these are completely different things

## Keep trying

> The road is made by walking; Walking makes the road.

## Split huge pull request in small ones. People will appreciate it

For instance, you're working with frontend and you have a task to create a Navigation component. Create a representational side of the component first, create pull request, code a business logic part, create a pull request. If you have something infrastructure related (e.g. Terraform), create a terraform configuration file and create a pull request. As the result of that we have 3 completely different pull requests, which are easy to review (maybe not easier, but less painfully) and everybody is way more happier 🙃

## Summary

1. Review meticulously. Review line by line, character by chacter
2. Don't order what to do, argue. Give your arguments instead
3. Create comments out of desire to improve, but not out of spite
4. Be specific in your intentions as much as you can
5. Figure out where code can be reviewed
6. Find your auspicious time for code reviews
7. Break your PRs appart
8. Respect others and be yourself
