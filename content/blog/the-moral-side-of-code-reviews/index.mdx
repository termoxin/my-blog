## Intro

Hi! I want to warn you that's my opinion can be different from yours, so take it easy. If you want to express your dissatisfaction, you can alway can comments section below.

So, without further ado let's get started

## Don't criticize people, criticize code they wrote

People tend to take everything personal. So, to don't offend them, offend their code and don't point at them by your finger

## Don't thrive vengeance, try to improve your code and code reviews instead

We probably had the situation where somebody reviewed your code harsly, they left a lot of comments and know you need to at least reply them. So, you thrive vengenace when you're reviewing their code, you're trying to touch people's emotions, feelings

## Review meticulously, we are human beings

We're human beings, and everybody can be wrong or miss something because of tiredness, feeling bad (in these situations it is better to relax a little bit), or because person focused on something else

## Don't order what to do, argue

Don't say "Do this because I think it's better than you wrote it". These words are coming from toxic person, that nobody wants to deal with. Don't you want to be this kind of person?. Instead say something like this "Please, do this because I think my solution is better then this solution, since it has better performance and reability". Don't orget what to do, argue, give your arguments

## Be specific in your intentions, ideas

Being specific is something incrediably importants for code reviews. It can save your a lot of time

## Have a convention about when code can be reviewed

To avoid a misunderstanding it's better to have a convetion about when code can be reviewed. So instance, you can use labels in your ui of your code hosting (labels, or draft pull request functionality). Since your teammates need to know when code can be reviewed to don't encounter with the situation when you're still working on something and they are reviewing it from inside in and inside out

## Review code in auspicious for you time

Don't review code when you're super tired or when you just want to do something else other than reviewing somebody's code. I think the best time to review code (especially hard to review PR's) first thing in the morning or in the middle of the day since your brain probably is not that exhausted

## Keep trying

The road is made by walking; Walking makes the road".

## Brake huge pull request in small ones. People will appreciate it

For instance, you're working with frontend and you have a task to create a FAQ component. Create a representational side of the component first, create pull request, code a business part, create a pull request. If you have something infrastructure related (e.g. Terraform), create a terraform configuration file and create a pull request. In the end we have 3 completely different pull requests, which are easy to review (maybe not easier, but less painfully).

## Summary
