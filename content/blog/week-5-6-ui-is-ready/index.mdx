Yooo, üëã The first month of summer is almost gone. How was your first month of summer? I hope it was the best in your life

## Intro

It was the best in my life, mostly because of insights and things I figured out. This makes it the best. One of my insights is that I never was lazy. I just didn't have enough energy or I didn't take action and risk because I didn't know what to do, but when you see where you're going and what you need to do to get there, you're not going to be lazy. You're not lazy, you just don't know what to do

And I'm really happy that's my life is moving in the right direction. I'm grateful for everything. I forgave all the hard feelings, I'm just happy for these people. I'm not gonna put my life on hold ever again because of inaction, fears, shyness. Never, never again!

I don't want to surround myself with miserable people, who complain about their lives, but I want to surround myself with successful, confident people who thrive on something, ones who control their lives and live to the fullest. It's going to happen sooner or later. I'm always getting what I want. So this is not going to be an exception.

Full throttle!

## Achievements

To be honest, the previous two weeks were ones of stagnation, the reason was quite simple, I finished the UI part for Thermo English project and I'll need to go down to the backend part, but I didn't know what to do. The same things I described in the intro above

I decided to act and I created [the stream](https://youtu.be/4MLKhKd7jg8) where I was talking about Thermo English, the main purpose of the project, and of course, the progress itself.

The stream helped me to create [a few issues on Github](https://github.com/termoxin/thermo-english/issues) to launch MVP as soon as possible. I've hit two birds with one stone. Firstly, I created the stream to make the project more recognizable in the outside world. Secondly, I blocked myself from inaction

## Next steps

The next steps are quite straightforward after the milestone on the Github repo was created

1. Implement Google authentication
2. Implement email and password authentication
3. Set up Firebase database and play around with that (create the database for posts)

## Agenda

I decided to post reports regarding Thermo English every 2 weeks instead of one week because it's hard to make something significant in one week, but I'm gonna start to create blog posts about tech, especially web development, and not only that. Here some of the ideas. You can write your ideas in the comments below. For instance:

1. How to Create Monorepo with Yarn 3 and TypeScript
2. Perfect React Component
3. Generic React Components
4. My path as a Software Engineer
5. How I went out of poverty
6. Why Watch later, Read later lists are dangerous things?
7. From Misunderstanding to Understanding
8. Simulating a real city with Three.js
9. Creating strategy (RTS) game using Google Maps
10. Why compassion is something everybody needs to have
11. How it feels like to live without parents whole life

So, feel free to write down your ideas in the comments below!

I ordered some lights for streams to have a little bit vibe and better video quality, so you'll see things in a different light. Literally, in a different light üí°

Also, I passed the theory exam on my way to getting driving license üöô Congrats!

## Conslusion

Finding the right direction is an important thing, but keep going in the right direction is an even more important one

#### What difficulties do you have in your Software Engineering career?
