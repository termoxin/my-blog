## Backstory

A few months I got an idea to create a startup that's gonna help car rental companies to rent their car faster and make them as busy as possible to increase their income and provide people with cars they want. Luckily, I had enough skills to pull it off and my desire and love for cars 💖 were going over the moon, so I decided to start with the name and logo.

Like every single startup in the world, RIGHT ?!

So, of course, before that, I had a lot of procrastination stuff, but now I'm good, so we can proceed. Let the presentation below tell you about the project a bit. By the way, here's the startup [website](https://takecar.co).

## What's TakeCar?

Here's the presentation that's gonna tell you more than a thousand words.

## What's progress so far?

✅ I’ve created a startup name and logo <br />
✅ I’ve created a simple website that’s gonna be a great foundation for future application <br />
✅ I’ve created MVP design for the website with basic features <br />
✅ I’ve contacted some Dubai car rental companies and one of them already can work with us

## Summary

I believe in this project, because I love cars and everything that related to them.
