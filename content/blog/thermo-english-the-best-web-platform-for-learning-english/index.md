As you can see on the screenshot above it is Termo English. It is because of a misspelling of *thermonuclear* word, but in the further future it'll be renamed to Thermo English. *Thermonuclear* because the channel and web platform can blow off your life to the moon. It can help you get dream job, create international business or business abroad, travel to other countries, watch movies in original, read book in originals and other stuff that you probably couldn't even dream of

English changed my life and I hope it is going to change yours. Just think about it a little bit, how many opportunities it'll open to you, how many new people you can meet. It's worth to invest some time to learn it. A proper goal can help you with that. If you're interested in how to set a goal for learning English, to get motivation. Let me know, I'll create a whole blog post for you 

## What's problem Thermo English solves?

Everybody knows that in the most schools and universities they don't teach us English, even most of paid courses don't. People are getting afraid of English. They're starting to think about speaking fluently and confidently in English as something beyond fiction and impossible thing to do, but honestly it is not. Thermo English will change your mind


**Thermo English** offers smooth and engaging English learning experience which is accomplished by gaming-like educational process. You can learn new expressions, words just playing as a warrior who's going through the jungles or as a sorcerer which's cleans caves of enemies

If you don't like game-like education process, you can simply learn English by interactive cards. It depends on your preferences, but I bet you, you're not going to regret if you try both
