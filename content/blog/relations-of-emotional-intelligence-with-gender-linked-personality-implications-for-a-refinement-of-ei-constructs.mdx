<li>Introduction
Emotional intelligence (EI) has been conceived of as a cognitive ability to be assessed using maximum-performance tests (Mayer, Salovey, &amp; Caruso, 2002) and as a constellation of affect-related personality traits measured through self-report (Petrides &amp; Furn- ham, 2006). Trait EI is located at the lower levels of personality hierarchies but has shown incremental validity over the Big Five personality traits and other related constructs in predicting af- fect-laden criteria (e.g., Petrides, Pita, &amp; Kokkinaki, 2007; Saklofske, Austin, &amp; Minski, 2003). The convergence between self-report and performance-based EI measures has been poor (e.g., Brackett &amp; Mayer, 2003; Warwick &amp; Nettelbeck, 2004), which may reflect measurement distinctions (e.g., typical vs. maximum performance) and/or discrepancies in the measures’ sampling domains. The ability EI approach has been criticized on conceptual and psycho- metric grounds (e.g., Brody, 2004; MacCann, Roberts, Matthews, &amp; Zeidner, 2004). A challenge pertaining to EI measures in general is deciding what to include within their content domains.

abstract
The present study examined the relationships of trait and ability emotional intelligence (EI) with the gen- der-linked personality (GLP) dimensions of Agency (intrapersonal orientation) and Communion (interper- sonal orientation). The explanatory power of GLP over the Big Five personality traits in predicting each EI type was also investigated. As hypothesized, Agency was more strongly associated with trait EI than Communion, highlighting the intrapersonal nature of most trait EI factors. The hypothesis that ability EI would be more strongly associated with Communion than Agency was also supported. GLP explained incremental variance in trait EI over sex and the Big Five and in ability EI over sex only. Discussion focuses on the implications for the conceptualization and measurement of EI constructs.

  1.1. Sex, EI, and personality
Further illustrating the distinction between the two EI types, sex differences vary depending on how EI is assessed. On the per- formance-based Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT, Mayer et al., 2002), women consistently outperform men in total ability EI and across the four subscales (e.g., Brackett, Rivers, Shiffman, Lerner, &amp; Salovey, 2006; Mayer et al., 2002). On self-report measures, sex differences in global trait EI are typically not observed in adult or adolescent samples (e.g., Brackett &amp; Mayer, 2003; Williams, Daley, Burnside, &amp; Hammond-Rowley, 2009). However, sex differences appear consistently at the factor and facet levels (e.g., Arteche, Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, &amp; Crump, 2008; Petrides, 2009), with women scoring higher on the interpersonal facets (e.g., empathizing with others) and men hav- ing higher scores on intrapersonal components (e.g., emotional self-control). Although the MSCEIT assesses emotional qualities related to one’s own and others’ emotions as well, a distinction between intrapersonal and interpersonal components is mostly apparent for self-report measures (e.g., Bar-On, 1997; Petrides &amp; Furnham, 2006).
The observed sex differences among trait EI scales are consis- tent with research showing that males tend to be more agentic and females more communal (e.g., Bakan, 1966). Agentic traits (e.g., assertiveness, competitiveness) are characterized by a focus on the self and autonomy, whereas communal traits (e.g., compas- sion, nurturance) signify an orientation towards others and rela- tionships (Helgeson, 1994). Meta-analytic results indicate that</li>
</ol>
<p>sex differences in various personality traits reflect Agency and Communion as superordinate factors (Feingold, 1994). Further- more, these two gender-linked personality (GLP) dimensions have been extracted from the Big Five in non-clinical samples (Digman, 1997) and also in a sample of male forensic psychiatric patients (Blackburn, Renwick, Donnelly, &amp; Logan, 2004). For example, Agency correlates negatively with Neuroticism and positively with Conscientiousness, whereas Communion correlates positively with Agreeableness (e.g., Marusic &amp; Bratko, 1998; Ward, Thorn, Cle- ments, Dixon, &amp; Sanford, 2006), a trait related to a person’s inter- personal functioning. Based on cross-situational observations, a recent study of young adults provided further evidence for Agency and Communion as fundamental personality dimensions (Leising &amp; Bleidorn, 2011). Therefore, EI scales conceptualized as interper- sonal (e.g., empathizing with others, controlling others’ emotions) may be very distinct from those EI scales that are more intraper- sonal in nature (e.g., identifying and controlling own emotions).
1.2. GLP and EI
The only preceding investigation of the relationships between EI and sex roles focused on masculinity and femininity (Guastello &amp; Guastello, 2003), which are multidimensional and multifaceted constructs (Deaux &amp; Lewis, 1984; Spence &amp; Helmreich, 1978) and therefore should be considered broader approximations of Agency and Communion only. EI was assessed with Schutte et al.’s (1998) single-factor Assessing Emotions Scale. Similar to the MSCEIT, this measure is based on Salovey and Mayer’s (1990) original model, but it differs in measurement format, relying on self-report. Thus, Schutte et al.’s scale is more representative of trait EI, given the poor convergence of maximum-performance and self-report mea- sures. Consistent with the presence of intra- and interpersonal items within Schutte et al.’s scale, masculinity and femininity were each positively associated with the trait EI scores of American col- lege students and those of their parents. However, the correlation coefficients for masculinity were moderate for each sex and across generations, whereas those for femininity were small. As indicated by the authors, possible relationships between GLP dimensions and ability EI remain to be investigated.
McIntyre (2010) derived an EI-weighted, general personality factor from an American sample of college students, based on the Big Five, trait EI (measured with Bar-On’s, 1997, Emotional Quo- tient Inventory), ability EI (measured with the MSCEIT), and verbal ability. However, the composition of this factor differed between male and female participants. Interpersonal trait EI loaded highest on the general personality factor for female participants, whereas intrapersonal trait EI was the highest loading variable for male par- ticipants. The MSCEIT scales were generally more reflective of fe- male participants’ personality factor, suggesting that the MSCEIT largely taps into interpersonal competence. However, the Manag- ing and Perceiving Emotions subscales were also characteristic of male participants’ personality factor (relative to the other do- mains). Overall, the general personality factors extracted in this study reflect the intrapersonal (agentic) and interpersonal (com- munal) dimensions on which women and men differ on average.
1.3. Present study
The objective of this study was to examine the interpersonal versus intrapersonal nature of both EI types, by examining their relations with GLP dimensions specifically. The focus was therefore on Agency and Communion rather than on masculinity and femi- ninity, which were the constructs of interest in Guastello and Guastello’s (2003) research. Trait EI was measured with the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue; Petrides &amp; Furn- ham, 2006), a newer self-report measure that was specifically de-
signed to tap into the construct of trait EI and yields four subfactors. As GLP dimensions share a fair amount of variance with the Big Five, a second objective of this study was to examine whether GLP dimensions explain incremental variance in EI types. The following hypotheses were tested:
H1a: Both GLP dimensions will correlate positively with global trait EI, with Agency being the stronger correlate. This hypoth- esis is based on the presence of intrapersonal and interpersonal facets within the TEIQue and consistent with Guastello and Guastello’s (2003) findings. The TEIQue comprises a greater number of intrapersonal than interpersonal facets.
H1b: Agency will correlate more strongly with the trait EI fac- tors of Self-Control and Well-Being, whereas Communion will be more strongly associated with Emotionality and Sociability. Self-Control and Well-Being consist of intrapersonal facets and Emotionality mainly of interpersonal facets. Sociability comprises intrapersonal and interpersonal facets but generally appears to be conceptualized as a social attribute (Petrides, 2009).
H2a: Communion will be associated with all four ability EI sub- scales (Perceiving, Using, Understanding, and Managing Emo- tions) and hence total ability EI. In McIntyre’s (2010) study, factor loadings of the MSCEIT domains on females’ general per- sonality factor ranged from .21 for Managing Emotions to .43 for Perceiving Emotions.
H2b: Agency will be significantly associated with the ability EI subscales of Managing and Perceiving Emotions. Factor loading of these two domains on males’ general personality factor were .37 and .29, respectively, and much larger than those for the other two scales.
H3: GLP will predict incremental variance in both EI types over the Big Five personality traits. The trait-coverage of Agency and Communion suggests that these personality dimensions are particularly valuable in explaining individual differences in psy- chological constructs that comprise both interpersonal and intrapersonal aspects.
2. Method
2.1. Participants and procedure
The participants were 662 undergraduate students (473 female, 189 male) with a mean age of 22.7 years (SD = 5.80). Students came from various academic disciplines at a large western Canadian uni- versity. The ethnic composition of the sample was 65.4% Caucasian, 14.0% Asian, 5.4% Indian, 2.9% Hispanic, and 12.3% other. Partici- pants completed self-report measures of trait EI, GLP dimensions, and the Big Five in the order listed in Section 2.2. Subsequently, they were invited to take the MSCEIT, resulting in a participation rate of 30.5% (202 administrations). Participants completed all measures anonymously online.
2.2. Measures
Table 1 shows the internal consistencies for each self-report measure.
2.2.1. Trait EI
The TEIQue–SF (Petrides &amp; Furnham, 2006) was used to mea- sure global trait EI (30 items) and its four subfactors (all 6 items, except 8 for Emotionality). Respondents answer statements by indicating their level of agreement with each statement on a 7- point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (com- pletely agree).

2.2.2. Ability EI
The MSCEIT Version 2.0 (Mayer et al., 2002) consists of 141 items, yielding a total ability EI score and four domain scores. It measures respondents’ ability to perform tasks and solve emo- tional problems and is appropriate for testing individuals of the ages 17 and older. The expert scoring method was selected arbi- trarily, converging strongly with the alternative procedure of con- sensus scoring (r = .93 to .99; Mayer et al., 2002). Thus, credit for correct answers was awarded based on how well the answers matched those of emotion experts. The test publisher does not pro- vide split-half reliability coefficients for ordered datasets (.91 for total ability EI and .76–.90 for subscales in the standardization sample). However, a scatter score assessing the amount of fluctua- tion in performance across tasks indicated a typical amount of var- iation in the task results (M = 99.26, SD = 13.91).
2.2.3. GLP dimensions
The Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ; Spence, Helmreich, &amp; Stapp, 1973) was used to measure Agency (8 items; e.g., ‘‘Not at all competitive.....Very competitive’’) and Communion (8 items; e.g., ‘‘Not at all helpful to others.....Very helpful to others’’). The PAQ measures these GLP dimensions rather than multidimensional
constructs of masculinity and femininity. As indicated, items are presented on 5-point bipolar scales. The two scales were developed by retaining those items that undergraduate students rated as so- cially desirable for both sexes but significantly more typical for one sex than the other. Hence, the PAQ is relatively independent from respondents’ gender stereotypes, granting its status as a personal- ity trait measure (Spence, Helmreich, &amp; Stapp, 1975).
2.2.4. Big Five
Neuroticism (8 items), Extraversion (8 items), Openness (10 items), Agreeableness (9 items), and Conscientiousness (9 items) were measured with the Big Five Inventory (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). Respondents indicate the degree to which brief descriptive items apply to them on 5-point scales, ranging from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly).</li>

Descriptive statistics and t-test results comparing male and female participants’ EI and GLP scores are displayed in Table 2.</li>

Following adjustment for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s correction, male participants had significantly higher scores on Self-Control; female participants had significantly higher scores on Emotionality, total ability EI, Perceiving Emotions, and Manag- ing Emotions. Further, there were significant sex differences in the expected directions for Agency and Communion.
3.2. Correlations
Table 1 also shows the two-tailed correlations for GLP dimen- sions, the Big Five, and EI scales. Both GLP dimensions were posi- tively associated with global trait EI and subfactors, with only a non-significant relationship between Communion and Self-Con- trol. Most correlation coefficients were in the moderate to large range and markedly stronger for Agency; Communion was more strongly associated with Emotionality only. In contrast, none of the correlation coefficients between Agency and ability EI scales were significant, whereas Communion was associated with total ability EI and three subscales (Perceiving, Using, and Managing Emotions). However, a one-tailed correlation between Agency and Managing Emotions, which was predicted, did reach signifi- cance, r(202) = .12, p = .04.
The Big Five were consistently associated with global trait EI and all subfactors. Neuroticism, Openness, Agreeableness, and Con- scientiousness also correlated with total ability EI. However, few correlations between the Big Five and ability EI subscales were sig- nificant. A notable exception was the Managing Emotions subscale, which was associated with all Big Five traits. In comparing the rela- tionships of GLP dimensions and the Big Five with ability EI, it should be noted that GLP, specifically Communion, was a stronger correlate of total ability EI and two subscales (Perceiving and Man- aging Emotions) than any Big Five trait.
3.3. Hierarchical regression analyses
Three-step hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the relative contributions of Agency and Communion and their incremental validity over the Big Five in predicting each EI type. The results for trait and ability EI scales are displayed in Ta- bles 3 and 4, respectively. Given the significant sex differences in

several study variables, sex was entered as a control variable at step 1 of each analysis.
At step 2, Agency and Communion together explained 49.7% of the variance in global trait EI and between 23.7% (Self-Control) to 36.4% (Sociability) of the variance in subfactors. Agency was a stronger correlate than Communion of global trait EI, Sociability, Self-Control, and Well-Being. Communion remained the stronger predictor of Emotionality and unrelated to Self-Control. Incremen- tal F ratios were consistently very significant (p &lt; .0001) for both GLP dimensions (step 2) and the Big Five (step 3). When the Big Five were added to the equation at step 3, GLP dimensions gener- ally remained significant predictors, except that Agency no longer accounted for a significant portion of variance in Emotionality.
Both GLP dimensions were also significant predictors of total ability EI at step 2. Additionally, Communion explained incremen- tal variance over sex for Using and Managing Emotions, and Agency over sex for Managing Emotions. Incremental F ratios for GLP dimensions (step 2) were significant for total ability EI (p &lt; .01), Using Emotions (p &lt; .05), and Managing Emotions (p &lt; .0001). With the Big Five entered at step 3, however, GLP dimensions no longer explained incremental variance. Similarly, only an incremental F ratio for the Big Five in predicting Managing Emotions was significant (p &lt; .05).
4. Discussion
This study examined (a) the intrapersonal versus interpersonal nature of both EI types by examining their relations with GLP dimensions, and (b) the incremental validity of GLP over the Big Five in predicting each EI type. In addition to focusing on both EI types and GLP dimensions specifically, this study differed from Guastello and Guastello’s (2003) work by using an advanced, mul- ti-factor questionnaire of trait EI. Supporting H1a and consistent with Guastello and Guastello’s findings, both GLP dimensions were associated with global trait EI, and Agency was the stronger corre- late than Communion. However, the correlation coefficients were notably stronger in the present study, which is most likely an effect of using different measures, as the sample resembled Guastello and Guastello’s college student sample. The significant correlations of both GLP dimensions with global trait EI reflect the presence of intra- and interpersonal trait EI facets within the TEIQue.

H1b predicted that Agency would correlate more strongly with the intrapersonal trait EI factors of Self-Control and Well-Being than Communion, whereas Communion was expected to be a stronger predictor of Emotionality and Sociability, which were hypothesized to be more interpersonal. This hypothesis was lar- gely supported, but Sociability correlated more strongly with Agency than Communion. Even though the Sociability factor re- lates to an individual’s behavior in social contexts, the facets of Assertiveness and Social Awareness are primarily indicative of per- sonal autonomy and adaptation to social situations. As noted by the developer of the TEIQue, the focus of the Sociability factor ‘‘is on the individual as an agent in social contexts’’ (Petrides, 2009, p. 94). Relating to, and concern for others seem to be of secondary relevance for these facets.
Hypotheses relating GLP dimensions to ability EI were based on previously published factor loadings of ability EI subscales on gen- eral personality factors (McIntyre, 2010). H2a, which predicted that Communion would be associated with total ability EI and sub- scales, was supported, although Communion was not associated with Understanding Emotions. H2b was partially supported, as only one of the two hypothesized correlations involving Agency was significant (Agency predicted Managing Emotions). However, GLP dimensions predicted incremental variance in participants’ trait EI scores only, resulting in partial support for H3 as well. It should be noted that two variables have less statistical power than five variables. Moreover, considering the apparent construct over- lap and potential shared-method variance of trait EI, GLP dimen- sions, and the Big Five, it is not surprising that personality traits shared less variance with ability EI. Overall, the results are consis- tent with the general personality factor extracted by McIntyre, which differed between males and females.
4.1. Implications
The findings have implications for the refinement of EI and re- lated constructs, suggesting a more rigid distinction between intra- personal and interpersonal facets. While most TEIQue factors relate to a person’s intrapersonal functioning, specifically affect, a notable exception appears to be the Emotionality factor, which mostly comprises emotion-related facets of an interpersonal nature (e.g., empathy, perception of others’ emotions, emotion expression,
relationships; Petrides, 2009). Additionally, Agency explained no incremental variance in Emotionality in the presence of the Big Five, which further highlights the distinctiveness of this trait EI fac- tor. In general, items and facets primarily related to a person’s rela- tions with, and concern for others (e.g., ‘‘I’m normally able to ‘get into someone’s shoes’ and experience their emotions’’) rather than one’s own emotional adaptation, may fit better with the construct of trait social intelligence recently proposed by Petrides and col- leagues (Petrides, Mason, &amp; Sevdalis, 2011). This step would render trait EI a purely intrapersonal concept, which makes conceptual sense and is consistent with overarching personality factors (Dig- man, 1997; Feingold, 1994).
In conjunction with previous findings (McIntyre, 2010), the re- sults indicate that the MSCEIT taps into interpersonal competen- cies to a greater extent than it captures intrapersonal skills that are primarily emotion-based. For example, the ability to interpret others’ facial expressions is largely a social one, as is the ability to manage other peoples’ emotions. Consistent with criticism sur- rounding the use of maximum-performance tests to measure sub- jective, intrapersonal phenomena to which only the individual has access, the MSCEIT might be improved by dropping all intraper- sonal components (e.g., tasks measuring the abilities to perceive and manage one’s own emotions); Performance-based measures might focus exclusively on interpersonal skills, specifically those that can be more objectively assessed through maximum-perfor- mance (e.g., identifying facial expressions), although there are lim- itations to measuring these domains as well (Brody, 2004; MacCann et al., 2004). More generally, the distinction between intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences is not a new one, and the field of EI might advance by revisiting it.
4.2. Limitations and future directions
The use of shorter self-report measures may have compromised the statistical power of the analyses. Replication with the full ver- sion of the TEIQue specifically will shed light on the intrapersonal versus interpersonal nature of each trait EI facet. Future research is also needed to examine the extent to which the results were influ- enced by measurement format (i.e., maximum-performance vs. typical performance) and/or discrepancies in the measures’ sam- pling domains. For example, whereas total ability EI was more</p>
<p>strongly associated with Communion in the present study, Agency was the stronger correlate of Schutte et al.’s (1998) Assessing Emo- tions Scale in previous research (Guastello &amp; Guastello, 2003). This measure is based on a similar model as the MSCEIT but relies on self-report. Future investigations may show that individual differ- ences in intrapersonal affect explain (i.e., mediate) the widely- investigated relationships of GLP dimensions with mental health.
