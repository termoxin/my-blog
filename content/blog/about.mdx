# Hello (from 2023)

I'm Rostyslav Futornyi or just simply — **Ros**.

I'm a Software Engineer with 6 years of commercial experience based in Bulgaria 🇧🇬 (Varna). Previosuly, I was living in Ukraine 🇺🇦 (Kiev) before war started. I moved on in the beginning of February.

I still do software engineering for fun and because I love it, but also I'm percolating about what else I can do to provide myself better conditions to live. Since, I've got a new car, this is a domain where I want to develop myself as well.

It's Audi S7 (**520 hp+**). **3.6s** to **100km/h**. It's freeking fast (as fast as RWD Lamborgini Aventador) 🤪.

**DM** ✍️ me (click on S7 logo) if you want to have a fast drive. I'm completely open for networking.

## What is this blog about?

I started [futornyi.com](https://futornyi.com) as a place to keep my journey documented. It is also a good place to show the progress that I'm doing in my projects and the things I'm working on.

Having a personal blog is a good opportunity to meet new people that have the same passion that I have and create something **big** together. Yeah, I'm talking about you. Yeah, I sad — "You"
