title: Microfrontends as A New Approach of Development
description: Rostyslav Futornyi tells you about that microfrontends is a modular approach to front-end web development that involves breaking down a web application into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. This approach allows teams to work independently on different parts of the front-end application, choose their preferred technology stack, and scale specific modules as needed. However, microfrontends also come with challenges, such as managing communication between modules and the complexity of the architecture. It is important to carefully weigh the benefits and challenges before deciding to adopt microfrontends.

## The Introduction

Front-end web development has undergone a significant transformation over the last few years. While the monolithic approach to front-end development has been the norm for years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain, test and deploy applications at scale. Microfrontends offer a new approach to front-end development that can help overcome some of these challenges.

## What are Microfrontends?

Microfrontends is a design approach that involves breaking down a web application into smaller, more manageable pieces. It is a modular approach to front-end development that borrows from the principles of microservices architecture. In a microservices architecture, an application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Similarly, in a microfrontends architecture, the front-end of a web application is broken down into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other.

Each microfrontend is responsible for a specific functionality or feature of the application. For instance, one module might handle the search functionality while another module might handle the checkout process. These modules can then be combined to form a complete front-end application.

## Benefits of Microfrontends

One of the main benefits of microfrontends is that it allows teams to work independently on different parts of the front-end application. This means that developers can work on different features without worrying about breaking the entire application. Teams can also choose the technology stack that works best for them, which can lead to greater innovation and faster development times.

Microfrontends also make it easier to scale applications. Instead of scaling the entire application, teams can scale specific modules that are experiencing higher traffic or demand. This makes it easier to handle spikes in traffic and ensures that the application remains responsive and performant.

## Challenges of Microfrontends

While microfrontends offer many benefits, they also come with their own set of challenges. One of the main challenges is managing communication between modules. In a monolithic architecture, communication between different parts of the application is straightforward since everything is running in the same process. However, in a microfrontends architecture, modules communicate with each other over a network, which can introduce latency and performance issues.

Another challenge is managing the complexity of the architecture. As the number of modules in the application increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage dependencies between modules and ensure that they are all working together correctly. This can lead to longer development times and increased maintenance costs.

## Conclusion

Microfrontends offer a new approach to front-end web development that can help overcome some of the challenges of monolithic architectures. By breaking down the front-end of a web application into smaller, more manageable modules, teams can work independently on different parts of the application and scale specific modules as needed. However, microfrontends also come with their own set of challenges, including managing communication between modules and the complexity of the architecture. As with any architectural decision, it is important to carefully weigh the benefits and challenges before deciding to adopt microfrontends.
